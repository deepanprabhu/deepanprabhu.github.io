# How to craft programming Functions

I have been programming for more than 15 years, and i have written lots of code.
When you spend so much time on something, getting expertise is inbuilt :).

But currently programming has become a means of making money and I have moved away from the art.

I chose my passion ( computer science ) as my career so that I could cherish it every moment, but when working for someone as an engineer , its more of a buisness rather than an art.

Lately, i spent some time to think about what **functions** are and how to write them ? How can we convey a mental model to people who learn programming to craft functions ?

Functions in programming are the same functions from mathematics.

For example, in mathematics, we describe a function that doubles a value as below,
f(x) = x*2;

The same function written in javascript is,

```javascript
function double(x) {
return x*2;
}
```
